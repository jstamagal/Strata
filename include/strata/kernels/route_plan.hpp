// include/strata/kernels/route_plan.hpp - STRATA_ROUTE_PLAN=1 (opt-in): the verify window's routing top-10 and the
// all-resident plan in ONE launch.  A node of the window's graph costs about 4 us on a Radeon PRO V620 before it does
// anything (router_chain_bench: an empty kernel 2.6 us, a one-row GEMV 3.9 us), and these two are small: 48 layers a
// window each run them back to back.  src/kernels/cuda/route_plan.cu has the kernel; hip_route_plan_parity checks
// ids, weights and the plan's bytes against native_router_top10_multi + resident_plan.
